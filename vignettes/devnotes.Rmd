## Developer Notes

### Data Version Control

Instead of committing big data files into `git`, we can store the files
remotely (e.g. Google Drive, AWS S3) and just keep track of the data
updates in `git` using [DVC](https://dvc.org/).

The R package uses the data files when running the code examples and tests, and
when rendering the vignettes. A simple `dvc pull` will pull the data from the
remote storage and allow these processes to take place. Hopefully.

| Command | Comments |
|---------|----------|
| `dvc init` | initialise dvc |
| `dvc remote add -d storage gdrive://<...>` | add GDrive remote |
| `dvc check-ignore *` | check what is dvc-ignored |
| `dvc list https://github.com/umccr/gpgr inst/extdata` | list dvc'ed data |
| `dvc add path/to/folder` | adds `folder` (and its contents) to dvc |
| `dvc add path/to/file.txt` | adds `file.txt` to dvc |
| `dvc push` | pushes dvc data to remote |
